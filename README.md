# Glacier Science

A collection of Data Science projects. 

### Why 'Glacier Science'? 
Glaciers have the power to modify the earth's surface. They are an immovable force. What do they hide underneath? How much information is just frozen, waiting to be uncovered? Data is similar to a glacier. It's an everlasting mystery of what can be found.
